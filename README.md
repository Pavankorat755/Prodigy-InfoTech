# My Python Projects

This repository contains several Python projects I've completed as assignments. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming, from encryption and image processing to network security and password strength assessment.

## Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher Text Encryption and Decryption
- **Description**: A program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  python caesar_cipher.py
- **Features**: Encrypts and decrypts text based on a shift value.
    
### 2. Image Encryption Tool using Pixel Manipulation
- **Description**:  A tool for encrypting and decrypting images using simple pixel manipulation.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  python image_encryption.py
- **Features**: Encrypts and decrypts images by manipulating pixel values.
  
### 3. Password Strength Assessment Tool
- **Description**:  A tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria.
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
